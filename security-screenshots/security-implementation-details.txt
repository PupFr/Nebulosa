=========================================
Organization: Frisky Developments
Implementation Date: July 25, 2025

OWASP SECURITY HEADERS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   - Purpose: Control referrer information sent to other sites
   - Implementation: Applied to all HTTP responses

2. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Purpose: Prevent MIME type sniffing attacks
   - Implementation: Server-side header injection

3. X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Purpose: Prevent clickjacking attacks
   - Implementation: Denies all frame embedding

4. X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Purpose: Enable XSS filtering in browsers
   - Implementation: Blocks suspected XSS attacks

5. Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   - Purpose: Enforce HTTPS connections
   - Implementation: 1-year HSTS policy with subdomain inclusion

6. Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
   - Purpose: Prevent XSS and data injection attacks
   - Implementation: Restrictive CSP with minimal inline allowances

7. Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
   - Purpose: Control browser API access
   - Implementation: Denies access to sensitive device APIs

OAUTH SECURITY MEASURES:
☑️ HTTPS-only redirect URLs (no HTTP allowed)
☑️ State parameter validation for CSRF protection
☑️ Secure error handling without information leakage
☑️ Environment-based secret management (no hardcoded values)
☑️ Minimal OAuth scope requests (principle of least privilege)
☑️ Token validation and sanitization

INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY:
☑️ Railway platform security compliance
☑️ Environment variable isolation (production separated)
☑️ SSL/TLS certificate automation
☑️ Production deployment security controls
☑️ Continuous security monitoring and alerting

DEPENDENCY SECURITY:
☑️ Package-lock.json for version consistency
☑️ Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
☑️ Automated security update notifications
☑️ Risk assessment for vulnerable dependencies
☑️ Documented mitigation strategies for known issues

INPUT VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING:
☑️ All user inputs sanitized and validated
☑️ SQL injection prevention (no direct SQL usage)
☑️ XSS prevention through proper encoding
☑️ Error messages sanitized (no sensitive info disclosure)
☑️ Rate limiting on API endpoints
☑️ Proper logging without sensitive data exposure

ACCESS CONTROL:
☑️ Group-based authorization (AUTHORIZED_GROUP_ID)
☑️ Role-based access control implementation
☑️ Session management security
☑️ Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
☑️ Audit logging for access attempts

MONITORING & INCIDENT RESPONSE:
☑️ Security event logging implemented
☑️ Real-time monitoring dashboards
☑️ Automated alerting for security events
