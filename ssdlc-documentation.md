# Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) Documentation

**Project**: Nebulosa Telegram Bot  
**Organization**: Frisky Developments  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 25, 2025

## 1. Development Process Overview

### 1.1 Requirements Phase

- **Security Requirements**: OAuth integration with secure token handling
- **Compliance Requirements**: Zoom API security standards
- **Data Protection**: No persistent storage of user credentials
- **Access Control**: Group-based authorization (AUTHORIZED_GROUP_ID)

### 1.2 Design Phase

- **Architecture Review**: Stateless bot design with external OAuth flow
- **Security Design**: Token-based authentication with secure redirect URLs
- **Threat Modeling**: Identified risks in OAuth callback handling
- **Security Controls**: Environment variable protection, HTTPS enforcement

### 1.3 Development Phase

- **Secure Coding Standards**: No hardcoded secrets, input validation
- **Code Review Process**: All commits reviewed before merge
- **Static Analysis**: npm audit integration in development workflow
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates via npm audit

### 1.4 Testing Phase

- **Security Testing**: OAuth flow vulnerability testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end OAuth flow validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage

### 1.5 Deployment Phase

- **Environment Security**: Production environment variable isolation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All callbacks use HTTPS
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based secret injection
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

### 1.6 Maintenance Phase

- **Security Updates**: Regular dependency updates
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning and patching
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous security assessment
- **Incident Response**: Documented security incident procedures

## 2. Security Checkpoints

### 2.1 Code Commit Gates

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets check
- ✅ Input validation verification
- ✅ Error handling review
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scan

### 2.2 Pre-Production Gates

- ✅ Full security audit (npm audit)
- ✅ OAuth flow security testing
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement verification

### 2.3 Production Gates

- ✅ Security header implementation
- ✅ Monitoring and logging setup
- ✅ Incident response procedures
- ✅ Backup and recovery procedures

## 3. Security Tools Integration

### 3.1 Static Analysis (SAST)

- **Primary Tool**: SonarQube Cloud
  - **Coverage**: Code quality, security vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10
  - **Integration**: GitHub Actions automation
  - **Reporting**: Professional compliance reports
  - **Quality Gates**: Automated pass/fail criteria

- **Secondary Tool**: npm audit
  - **Coverage**: Dependency vulnerabilities
  - **Frequency**: Every commit
  - **Action**: Automatic fix application

- **Additional Tools**: ESLint security plugins, Manual code review

### 3.2 Dynamic Analysis (DAST)

- **Tool**: Manual OAuth flow testing
- **Frequency**: Every deployment
- **Coverage**: OAuth callback security
- **Action**: Security validation

### 3.3 Dependency Scanning

- **Tool**: npm audit + package-lock.json
- **Frequency**: Continuous
- **Coverage**: Third-party vulnerabilities
- **Action**: Automated patching

## 4. Team Security Responsibilities

### 4.1 Development Team

- Implement secure coding practices
- Perform security-focused code reviews
- Run security scans before commits
- Follow secret management procedures

### 4.2 DevOps Team

- Maintain secure deployment pipelines
- Monitor production security events
- Manage environment variable security
- Implement security updates

### 4.3 Security Team

- Review security architecture
- Validate security implementations
- Manage incident response

## 5. Security Metrics

### 5.1 Vulnerability Management

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 tolerance in production
- **Time to Patch**: <24 hours for critical, <7 days for moderate
- **Dependency Updates**: Monthly security update cycles
- **Scan Coverage**: 100% of dependencies

### 5.2 Process Compliance

- **Code Review Coverage**: 100% of commits
- **Security Testing**: 100% of deployments
- **Documentation**: All security processes documented
- **Training**: Quarterly security training

## 6. Evidence and Artifacts

### 6.1 Security Scan Results

- **SonarQube Cloud Analysis**: 15 security issues identified and reviewed
  - **Zoom API Key Management**: Proper environment variable usage confirmed
  - **Bot Token Security**: Secure implementation validated
  - **OAuth Credentials**: Environment-based secret management verified
  - **Professional Assessment**: Enterprise-grade SAST tool validation

- **npm audit Analysis**: 6 vulnerabilities identified and documented
- **Remediation**: Security fixes applied via npm audit fix
- **Verification**: Post-fix validation completed
- **Documentation**: Full audit reports generated (sonarqube-security-response.md)

### 6.2 Process Documentation

- **SSDLC Framework**: This document
- **Security Assessment**: security-assessment-report.md
- **Compliance Evidence**: JSON audit results
- **Team Acknowledgment**: Development team trained and aware

## 7. Compliance Statement

This SSDLC framework demonstrates our organization's commitment to secure software development practices. The process incorporates security considerations at every phase of the development lifecycle, from requirements gathering through production maintenance.

**Team Acknowledgment**: The development team has been trained on and follows these security practices as part of our standard development workflow.
