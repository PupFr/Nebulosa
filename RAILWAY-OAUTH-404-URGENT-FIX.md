# üö® URGENT: Railway OAuth 404 Fix - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## ‚ùå **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
Railway is serving their default API page instead of your bot!
- **Root URL**: Shows Railway ASCII art ‚ùå
- **OAuth Callback**: Returns 404 "Not Found" ‚ùå
- **Health Check**: Works but returns basic "OK" ‚ùå

## ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **STEP 1: Fix Railway Deployment** ‚ö° (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Find your `nebulosa-production` service

2. **Check Service Configuration:**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"General"**
   - Verify **Start Command** is set to:
     ```
     node railway-bot-simple.js
     ```

3. **Trigger Manual Deployment:**
   - Go to **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click **"Deploy"** to force redeploy
   - Wait 30-60 seconds

### **STEP 2: Verify Fix** ‚ö° (30 seconds)

Test these URLs after Railway redeploys:

1. **Root endpoint should return JSON:**
   ```bash
   curl https://nebulosa-production.railway.app/
   # Expected: {"status":"healthy","platform":"railway",...}
   ```

2. **OAuth callback should return HTML:**
   ```bash
   curl https://nebulosa-production.railway.app/auth/zoom/callback
   # Expected: <h1>‚ùå No Authorization Code</h1>
   ```

### **STEP 3: Test Zoom OAuth** ‚ö° (1 minute)

1. **After Railway is fixed**, add Railway callback to Zoom app:
   - Go to: https://marketplace.zoom.us/develop/apps
   - Find Client ID: `vGVyI0IRv6si45iKO_qIw`
   - Add redirect URI: `https://nebulosa-production.railway.app/auth/zoom/callback`

2. **Test `/zoomlogin`:**
   - Send `/zoomlogin` to @La_NUBE_bot
   - Click authorization link
   - Should work without 4.700 error!

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE:**

Railway is running the wrong service or using wrong start command.

**Current behavior:**
- Railway shows ASCII art ‚Üí Wrong service/command
- OAuth endpoints missing ‚Üí Not running `railway-bot-simple.js`

**Expected behavior:**
- Railway returns JSON health status
- OAuth callback returns HTML page
- All endpoints functional

## ‚ö° **QUICK VERIFICATION:**

After fixing Railway deployment, these should work:

```bash
# Test 1: Health check
curl https://nebulosa-production.railway.app/
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","platform":"railway"...}

# Test 2: OAuth callback
curl https://nebulosa-production.railway.app/auth/zoom/callback
# Should return: HTML with "No Authorization Code" message

# Test 3: Telegram bot
# Send /start to @La_NUBE_bot - should respond immediately
```

---

**üéØ PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **Fix Railway deployment** (Start command + redeploy)
2. **Add callback URI to Zoom app** 
3. **Test `/zoomlogin`** - should work perfectly!

**‚ö° CRITICAL: The 4.700 error is happening because Railway isn't running your bot properly!**
