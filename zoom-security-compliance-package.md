# Zoom Security Compliance Package

**Organization**: Frisky Developments  
**Project**: Nebulosa Telegram Bot  
**Submission Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Compliance Type**: Beta Pub URL Requirements

## Executive Summary

This package provides evidence of our comprehensive security practices to meet Zoom's Beta Pub URL requirements. We are submitting evidence for **Option 1 (SSDLC)** and **Option 2 (SAST/DAST)** as requested.

## 1. Evidence of SSDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle)

### Document Reference: `ssdlc-documentation.md`

**Key SSDLC Elements Implemented:**

1. **Security Requirements Integration**
   - OAuth security standards compliance
   - Secure token handling procedures
   - Group-based access control implementation

2. **Security Design Process**
   - Threat modeling for OAuth flows
   - Secure architecture review
   - Security control implementation

3. **Development Security Gates**
   - Secure coding standards enforcement
   - Mandatory code review process
   - Static analysis integration (npm audit)
   - Dependency vulnerability management

4. **Testing Security Validation**
   - OAuth flow security testing
   - End-to-end security validation
   - Error handling security review

5. **Production Security Controls**
   - Environment variable isolation
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Security header implementation
   - Continuous monitoring

**Team Acknowledgment**: Development team trained and follows documented SSDLC process.

## 2. Evidence of SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

### Security Scan Results

**Tool Used**: npm audit (Industry standard Node.js security scanner)  
**Scan Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Scan Coverage**: 100% of dependencies (233 packages)

**Initial Findings:**

- Total Vulnerabilities: 6
- Critical: 2 (form-data unsafe random, request SSRF)
- Moderate: 4 (tough-cookie prototype pollution, dependency chain)

**Remediation Actions:**

1. ✅ Generated comprehensive security audit report
2. ✅ Applied npm audit fix for automatic remediation
3. ✅ Updated vulnerable dependencies
4. ✅ Implemented additional security headers (OWASP compliance)
5. ✅ Documented all findings and fixes

**Post-Remediation Status:**

- Security headers implemented (Referrer-Policy, X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- Dependency updates applied where possible
- Remaining vulnerabilities documented with mitigation strategies
- Continuous monitoring implemented

### SAST Evidence Files

- `security-assessment-report.md` - Detailed vulnerability analysis
- `npm-audit-results.json` - Raw scan data
- `security-headers.js` - OWASP security header implementation

## 3. Additional Security Measures

### 3.1 OWASP Security Headers Implementation

```javascript
// Implemented security headers:
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
- Content-Security-Policy: strict policy implemented
- Permissions-Policy: restricted permissions
```

### 3.2 OAuth Security Measures

- HTTPS-only redirect URLs
- State parameter validation
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Environment-based secret management

### 3.3 Infrastructure Security

- Railway platform security compliance
- Environment variable isolation
- Production deployment security
- Continuous security monitoring
