# Zoom Security Compliance Requirements

## Current Situation

Zoom requires 2 of the following for Beta Pub URL approval:

1. **Evidence of SSDLC** - Secure Software Development Life Cycle
2. **Evidence of SAST/DAST** - Static/Dynamic Application Security Testing  
3. **Evidence of 3rd Party Penetration Testing**

## Immediate Action Plan

### Option 1: SSDLC Documentation (Easiest)

- Document our development process
- Show security checkpoints in workflow
- Include code review processes
- Show deployment security measures

### Option 2: SAST/DAST Implementation (Quick)

- Run static code analysis tools
- Use security scanners on live application
- Generate security scan reports
- Take screenshots of scan results

### Option 3: Penetration Testing (Most Expensive)

- Hire security firm for pen testing
- Get formal security assessment
- Provide cover page and findings summary

## Recommended Approach

**Implement Options 1 + 2** (SSDLC + SAST/DAST) as they are:

- Cost-effective
- Can be done immediately
- Provide comprehensive security evidence

## Tools to Use

- **SAST**: ESLint security plugins, Semgrep, SonarQube
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Community
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, Snyk
- **Security Headers**: SecurityHeaders.com scan

## Timeline

- SSDLC Documentation: 1-2 hours
- SAST/DAST Scans: 30 minutes
- Report Generation: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~3 hours to compliance
